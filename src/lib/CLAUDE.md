# Backend / Data Layer Context (src/lib)

## Scope
Everything under `src/lib/` — the data-access layer, business logic (reward calculations, milestone math, FY date logic), and anything API routes in `src/app/api/` call into. This is the "backend" half of the project.

## Rules
1. **Single data-access layer.** All reads/writes to the database (currently local JSON at `/data/database.json`, later Google Sheets) go through functions defined in `src/lib/data/`. Exact function signatures are documented in `/docs/data-layer-contract.md` — this contract must stay in sync with actual code.
2. **No business logic duplicated across routes.** Reward/milestone/cap calculations live in `src/lib/calculations/`, imported wherever needed, never recomputed inline in an API route.
3. **Sensitive field boundary.** Any function that builds a payload for the AI assistant (Gemini) or any export feature MUST go through a single explicit "sanitize" function (`src/lib/security/sanitize.ts`, to be created) that strips encrypted/sensitive fields. This is a hard security boundary — see /SECURITY.md.
4. **Encryption isolated to one module.** AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt logic lives only in `src/lib/security/encryption.ts`. No other file touches the raw encryption key.
5. **Every calculation function gets a unit test** before being considered done — especially FY date math, milestone tier math, and the expected-cashback formula. See /TESTING.md.

## Current state
Phase 0: no data layer code written yet. Schema defined in /docs (13-tab structure) but not yet implemented as JSON.

## Update this file
Whenever a new module is added to src/lib/, document its responsibility and what it must never do, here.
